# Shoping cart with React & Typescript

This project includes was bootstrapped with Vite, React, and Typescript. 

For styles we are using bootstrap for a faster development, because our interest is not really styles. 



### About data
We are not using any king of API here, just using some static data from a JSON file in the `data` folder. Of course you can use Axios or whatever you want to do this from a API.
